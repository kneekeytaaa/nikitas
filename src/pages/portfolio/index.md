  During my 3-year course at Symbiosis Centre of Media and Communication, I got
  a chance to push my limits and try my best at creativity through assignments
  and activities. I got a chance to work on Marketing Pitches, Creative Briefs,
  Copywriting, Account Planning, Revamp Strategies and a lot more. At my
  Internships, I got a chance to learn communication management to its core.  I
  got an opportunity to work as a Digital Marketing executive and try my hands
  working for several local, national and international brands and companies. 
  For me, it's a wonderful and special feeling to see my own work published on
  the social media handles of these accounts.  It inspires me and gives me a
  push to do better.  So, here's to building brands!
