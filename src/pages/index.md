      I am a 21-year-old Mass Communication student and an upcoming media
      professional. I graduated with the batch 2020 during a global pandemic,
      which makes it interesting already! I enjoy approaching complex projects
      with a holistic approach. A large part of my success while working with
      people stems from my ability to cultivate an intuitive understanding of
      their needs, and spearhead the project from there. Have a look at the work
      Iâ€™ve done in the past, and get in touch to learn more.
