      I am a 21-year-old Mass Communication student and an upcoming media
      professional. I graduated with the batch 2020 during a global pandemic,
      which makes it interesting already! I enjoy approaching complex projects
      with a holistic approach. A large part of my success while working with
      people stems from my ability to cultivate an intuitive understanding of
      their needs, and spearhead the project from there. Have a look at the work
      I’ve done in the past, and get in touch to learn more.

          In my free time, I doodle and make DIY art. Sometimes I dab hands at
          cooking. I recently started blogging my dishes on Instagram
          @nikkirheablog. I love teaching kids and I usually involve myself in
          NGOs for child support. I currently volunteer at Nachiket Balgram an
          orphanage in Pune. With a perpetual hunger for knowledge in cinema, I
          am a social media enthusiast with a head for marketing. Having watched
          Mad Men, I wanted to be the Don Draper of the world, but the quick
          realization DON-ed upon me that the AD world is more than just
          whiskeys and charms. It’s an entourage of people who survive on
          creativity. And so, I hope to find a place in this Mad world.
