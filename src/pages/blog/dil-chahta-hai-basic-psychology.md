Three friends who share a deep bond are separated due to their different approaches towards relationships. Akash goes to Australia, Sameer gets busy wooing a girl and Siddharth devotes himself to art. `Release date: 24 July 2001 (India)
Director: Farhan Akhtar`[`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13b25V0B10`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13b25V0B10)

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m13b25V0B10)DCH launched the career of one of the most talented men in Bollywood today. There was a freshness about that film which stole the hearts of the youth and the film has gone on to achieve the status of a cult classic through the years.The debut film of Farhan Akhtar broke traditions in excess of one different ways. It connected with substantial urban youth audience showed them a cut of their lives, in a way that wasn't done in Bollywood before. The film was rooted in the urban upper middle-class sensibilities, it wasn't about event of the super-rich or the poor man's battle against the system, like other film makers in the late 90's. It had unconventional romances- at least unconventional approaches towards romance and love which were presented from the perspective of each character.

The three lead characters of Dil Chahta Hai, Akash represents id, Sid represents superego and Sameer represents the ego! Freud stated that any person's psyche consists of three aspects, which he called the Id, the Ego and the Superego.

* The id is the primitive and instinctive component of a person's personality. It's the unconscious part of the mind and mostly works on pleasure principles- food, sex and aggression being the main component.
* The superego consists of the set of values and morals of society. The superego is constantly in struggle with the Id's impulses.
* Ego is the realist among the three and develops in order to mediate between the constantly conflicting unrealistic id and the real world.

The story of three friends is told as flashback were both Sameer and **Siddharth** reminisce about the time spent together and then apart. Without any over the top display of their friendship and it focuses more on the conflicting behaviors held by the individual characters. Every character has his own understanding of love in their lives.

Sameer, played by **Saif Ali Khan**, a believable and relatable character, who was constantly swinging between love and infatuation.

Siddharth, played brilliantly by **Akshay Khanna**, had a unique perspective towards love. A highly self-aware person, he fell in love with a divorcee woman much older than himself and was okay with his love not being requited.

**Aamir Khan's** as Akash, on the other hand, was someone who didn't really deal with his emotions and chose to run away from them instead. We see him deny the existence of the phenomenon called true love throughout in the film.

**Dil Chahta hai** is a character driven film. There is an abstract presence of id, ego and superego. Akash works clearly on pleasure principles. Instances like his need to approach an unknown girl and propose her without any consequences, The Spontaneous trip to goa, Challenging people to accompany him on dangerous rides. Infact he is the only character in the movie who has been shown eating for more than once. All this point out to Id.

**Siddharth is the super ego**, for being in constant conflict with Akash's id. He represents the ideal scenario. Superego and Id are at constant battle with each other of fulfilling your immediate desire and doing the right thing. He shows restrain or aggression in his behavior. There are scenes where Siddharth lashes out on Akash. Also, the fact that Siddhart is confused about his love interest and is always looking for his ideal set in his mind.

**Sameer the ego** is left helpless, he struggles to reach his ideal state of Siddhart or recognizing his Id represented by Akash. He is afraid to take spontaneous and stopped my his superego.

The theme of fear is the most visible in Aakash, and in his relationship with Shalini. While Sameer is afraid of losing love, and Sid is afraid of not being understood by his love, Aakash is afraid of falling in love. Together these three characters form the personality of the film, characters are metaphors for the innate quirks that we all possess and the battles we fight in our subconscious every day. Just like the characters in the movie we are all involved in the perpetual struggles where are ego battles to balance the Id and superego.

Film is not just about youth, friendships and how your life changes as you grow up and Akash's cynicism, Sameer's naivete, and Siddharth's willingness to fight for love in ourselves. There’s a much deeper narrative embedded in it that makes it so relatable to each individual – the struggle to balance your desires with what’s right.
