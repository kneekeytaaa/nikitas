The Civil Rights Movement of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s was arguably one of the most formative and influential periods in American history. Non-violent protests and civil disobedience during this
time caused many crisis situations where the government had to take action. These showed
the inequities and injustice that was happening to Blacks. The protests were done with sit-ins,
marches, and boycotts. Notable legislation during this time included the:

* Civil Rights Act of 1964 - This banned discrimination in employment and public accommodations based on "race, color, religion, or national origin".
* Voting Rights Act of 1965 - This act restored and protected the right to vote.
* Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965 - This allows immigration from groups other
  than those from the traditional European countries.
* Fair Housing Act of 1968 - This banned housing discrimination for sales or rentals.



**Martin Luther King Jr.** (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist minister and activist who became the most visible spokesperson and leader in the civil rights movement.
In December, 1955, Rosa Parks, African American, was arrested when she refused to give up
her seat on a city bus to a white man. Leaders of the African American community met in King’s
church. Under his leadership they organized a boycott of the bus system that lasted more than
a year. Before it ended, King’s home was firebombed, and he was jailed for the first of many
times. The boycott was successful and King emerged as a national figure in the Civil Rights
movement, which mobilized millions of people to break down the barriers to racial equality.
African American clergymen organized the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
and made King its president. King used the SCLC to organize high-visibility, nonviolent
campaigns against discriminatory practices, hoping that exposing the evils of racism would
arouse national consciousness against its debilitating effects. One of the most famous of his
campaigns was a march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, in which his supporters faced
powerful opposition while exercising their right to protest their grievances and express their
determination to vote. King’s philosophy stood not just for “opportunity,” but for positive
measures toward economic equality and political power. Ignoring this understanding betrays
the “dream” that is ritually invoked each year. 

Faced with abuse on all sides, King has not only remained temperate but has continued to seek reconciliation—both within the African American community and also interns of a larger
alliance with disaffected whites. At the same time, he has continued to speak his mind, refusing
to let pleas for tactical caution obscure the imperative responsibility he feels (which every

citizen should feel) to apply ethical standards to international as well as domestic questions. To have managed all this in the face of heavy pressures and wounding accusations bespeaks a
character of rare stability, breadth and integrity. 
Dr. King gave many speeches. Pretty much all of them were eloquent. But one presumes that
you’re talking about the “I have a dream” speech, delivered on August 28, 1963

* It brought Dr. King to the attention of the nation. It was probably the first time his words had been broadcast on national TV, and it was extensively covered in major newspapers
  across the country.
* It was part of a march that brought 250,000 people to the nation’s capital. That was a
  huge gathering for the time and put the nation on notice that there were many people
  who were serious about the cause of civil rights.
*  It cemented Dr. King’s role as the leader of the civil rights movement in America.



Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights movement relied heavily on Christianity to gain support for their political goals, but they emphasized its message of love and acceptance of all
people in pursuit of equal rights. Inspired by advocates of nonviolence such as Mahatma
Gandhi, King sought equality for African Americans, the economically disadvantaged and
victims of injustice through peaceful protest.
He was the driving force behind watershed events which helped bring about such landmark
legislation as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In the end, the
majority of Americans accepted the Civil Rights legislation because the leaders of the
movement changed opinions with a compelling message, not a pistol to the head or bomb
strapped to the chest.
His marches and agitation and the cruelty of the southerners against the peaceful marches
galvanized the nation's thinking about racial discrimination and helped strengthen Johnson's
hand in getting the voting rights and other civil right legislation passed. His movement helped
the nation eliminate discriminatory laws both in the North and South. It did not, however,
change human behavior much. The massive movement of poorly educated southern blacks to
northern cities resulted in massive segregation and white flight. Although residential
integration measures have improved, we are still a highly segregated society both by race and
social class. Desegregation of schools and other public spaces came about by Supreme Court
Action. 
Although King renounced the Viet Nam war, his voice was one of a nation-wide movement and
probably had little impact independently.
The critical contribution of King was the policy of non-violence. Had blacks followed black
nationalists and resorted to violence to achieve equality, it would have set back the civil rights
movement. Violence and riots in the cities were not a result of King's teachings, but of black
anger at his death.

Still a race that suffered discrimination and legal inequality was able to achieve equal rights through a peaceful movement that emphasized love, not hate, as the impetus for change. This
is a unique accomplishment. This is why the Civil Rights movement is not only a significant
accomplishment in black history and American history, but world history as well.
