Steve Jobs is one of the best presenters, with ability to get his message across so clearly and effectively.His great oratory and presentation skills have helped his company to grow. One of his
great speech was &quot;the launch of the iPad in 2010 &;. Like all his presentations this too starts by
having a well-designed structure. Steve Jobs throughout his speech focused on **opening, body
and closing.**
In the opening Steve Jobs first overviewed of the company status-mainly good news about
product sales and the large customer base. Then he threw out a question: “*Is there a 3rd category
device between a smart phone and a laptop?*” thus gave a perfect introduction to the iPad .In the
body he gave a detailed Overview and demo of what iPad can do and Hardware features. He kept
the conversation going through pictorial presentation.
Steve Jobs utilized this product launch opportunity not only to introduce the new product but
also to persuade the audience to own it showcasing his excellent salesmanship After the demo of
what the iPad can do, Jobs said, “I have to say, though, watching it is nothing like getting it in
your hands and feeling it right underneath your fingers.” This is to tell the audience that you need
to own this gadget to really feel its charm, me made sure to use adjectives to make his product
wanted.
Unveiling the price of iPad, Steve first recapped the product benefits: what iPad can do, Apps,
iBook App, iWork App..He didn’t tell the price right away. But to build some suspense and also
contrast, he gave a price in as $999 while describing all the features which add up to this sum.
Later he set the price to $499, for the most basic model and higher prices for other more
advanced models. Here Steve used two skills. The first one is to mention benefits before the
price so that buyers are reminded of the wonderful benefits of this product first and then are
more likely to accept the price. The second skill Steve used is to give a higher price first and then
the real lower price. This contrast of prices naturally makes the buyer feel the actual price is
really low and it’s a great deal to get it at this price.
Jobs made opening of the presentation well-structured to serve as a set up for the closing. The
opening’s main message was Apple having a massive customer base links, while the closing
message was the massive customer base was the customer foundation for iPad and why iPad will
take off strong in the market.
He mentioned “*Everybody uses a laptop or smart phone… Is there a room for the 3rd category of
device in the middle? Something between a laptop and a smart phone?*”

While Closing: “So let’s go back to the beginning. Do we have what it takes to establish a 3rd category product, an awesome product that’s in between a laptop and a smart phone…We think
we got the goods. We think we’ve done it.”


If there is one thing that differentiates Steve Jobs from other great speakers, it is his speaking
speed. Steve is 50% slower when he speaks. He enunciates each word clearly and he takes time
to emphasize the key words and messages. The effect of his slow pace is that audience will feel
very comfortable following him without being rushed or missing anything he said. As a result, he
gets his message across successfully.
A good presenter connects with the audience on a personal level by expressing his own
emotions. Steve Jobs is such a presenter. Apart from this Steve kept the humor sidelines to keep
the audience entertained, He also knows the power of repetition to strike his main messages in
the audience minds.
Jobs presentation was simple lucid and easy to grasp i.e. one message per slide. Besides, the
most important message is put in bigger font while narratives in smaller font. He made sure to
use the presentation as an aid and didn’t glance at it while delivering, this highlighted his
confidence.
Steve Jobs smartly utilized the product launch opportunity to promote the company and build up
its Apple brand. In the beginning of the presentation, Steve Jobs gave a positioning to Apple:

>
> “Apple is a mobile devices company. That’s what we do.” &quot;If you think Apple is just a digital
> appliance company, then after listening to this speech, you know that to be specific, Apple is a
> mobile devices company."


At the end of the presentation, Steve Jobs reiterated the competitive advantage of Apple: “We’ve
always tried to be at the crossroad of technology and liberal arts, to be able to get the best of the
both.” This is what differentiates Apple from other technical companies.


Steve Jobs in his 1.5-hour iPad product launch presentation delivered an amazing and
commendable performance. Steve was a master in structuring and executing his pitch. Although
it’s pretty easy when you are the CEO of an impressive company, Steve did a great job in
grabbing the attention from the beginning all the way to the end. Steve is a role model as a highly
effective technical presenter. All these skills make him one of the best orators of time, he gave
his company a new face just by showing amazing presentation skills and unique ability to
convince, influence his audience.
